Hi, I'm Michael. I studied ECE/CS in school, worked professionally as an Embedded Software Engineer for ~8 years, and now I'm making games.

In no particular order, my hobbies include: skiing, hiking, photography, video games, reading fiction, writing, mountain biking, playing saxophone, and probably a few more that I've forgotten about.
